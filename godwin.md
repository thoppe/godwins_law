### Godwin's Law 
Mike Godwin ([Wired 1994](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if_pr.html))
> "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1". 
#### No empirical studies to date! Let's test it!

Any conversation is effectively over once someone makes a
comparison to one of the worst genocides in history.


An implicit assumption* is that conversation
is over once the atrocities of the third Reich are invoked.

### Ongoing research!

What does the null look like? e.g. The Hitler vs puppies?

Does a conversation stop post-Godwin?

What is the _quality_ of conversation post-Godwin?

Can we try to prevent it? Should we?

Is Reddit pathological or representative?
