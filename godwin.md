Why is this important?

Premise: Conversation is a good thing, but 

ON THE INTERNET EVERYONE IS AN ASSHOLE.

Any conversation is effectively over once someone makes a compairision to one of the worst genocides in history.

Godwin's hypthesis is the implict assumption that conversation is over once the atrocites of the third Reich are invoked.
