### Godwin's Law
An [eponymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponym) law that states:

> As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1

No empirical studies to date! Let's test it!

## Godwin's Law

#### Weak form

As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a
comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.

#### Strong form

As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a
comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1
*when not talking about the events of WWII*.

#### Why is this important? (aka the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory)
Premise: Conversation is a good thing, but ...

Any conversation is effectively over once someone makes a
comparison to one of the worst genocides in history.

Godwin's hypothesis is the implicit assumption that conversation
is over once the atrocities of the third Reich are invoked.

### Dataset

A few months ago, `u/stuck_in_the_matrix` [download](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/) _every comment_ from Reddit. It took about 9 months 100 GB compressed and about 1 TB uncompressed raw json blobs.

105,925,637 submissions (posts) and 971,555,203 comments.

189,283 invokations of Godwin's law, 69,912 when considering conversations of length > 50.
